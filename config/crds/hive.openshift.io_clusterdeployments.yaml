                          CertificatesSecretRef refers to a secret that contains CA certificates

                          There is additional configuration required for the OpenShift cluster to trust
                          the certificates provided in this secret.
                          The "clouds.yaml" file included in the credentialsSecretRef Secret must also include
                          a reference to the certificate bundle file for the OpenShift cluster being created to
                          trust the OpenStack endpoints.
                          The "clouds.yaml" file must set the "cacert" field to
