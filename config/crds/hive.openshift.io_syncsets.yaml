                  ApplyBehavior indicates how resources in this syncset will be applied to the target

                  using the 'oc apply' command. If no value is set, "Apply" is assumed.
                  A value of "CreateOnly" indicates that the resource will only be created if it does
                  not already exist in the target cluster. Otherwise, it will be left alone.
                  A value of "CreateOrUpdate" indicates that the resource will be created/updated without
                  the use of the 'oc apply' command, allowing larger resources to be synced, but losing
                  some functionality of the 'oc apply' command such as the ability to remove annotations,
