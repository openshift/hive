                              Expects an unsigned duration string of decimal numbers, each with optional
                              fraction and a unit suffix, eg "300ms", "1.5h" or "2h45m".
                              Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs" U+00B5 or "μs" U+03BC), "ms", "s", "m", "h".

                              Setting this to less than 5s can cause excess traffic due to too frequent
                              TCP health checks and accompanying SYN packet storms.  Alternatively, setting
                              this too high can result in increased latency, due to backend servers that are no
                              longer available, but haven't yet been detected as such.

                              An empty or zero healthCheckInterval means no opinion and IngressController chooses
                              a default, which is subject to change over time.
                              Currently the default healthCheckInterval value is 5s.

                              Currently the minimum allowed value is 1s and the maximum allowed value is
                              2147483647ms (24.85 days).  Both are subject to change over time.

                              maxConnections defines the maximum number of simultaneous
                              connections that can be established per HAProxy process.
                              Increasing this value allows each ingress controller pod to
                              handle more connections but at the cost of additional
                              system resources being consumed.

                              Permitted values are: empty, 0, -1, and the range
                              2000-2000000.

                              If this field is empty or 0, the IngressController will use
                              the default value of 50000, but the default is subject to
                              change in future releases.

                              If the value is -1 then HAProxy will dynamically compute a
                              maximum value based on the available ulimits in the running
                              container. Selecting -1 (i.e., auto) will result in a large
                              value being computed (~520000 on OpenShift >=4.10 clusters)
                              and therefore each HAProxy process will incur significant
                              memory usage compared to the current default of 50000.

                              Setting a value that is greater than the current operating
                              system limit will prevent the HAProxy process from
                              starting.

                              If you choose a discrete value (e.g., 750000) and the
                              router pod is migrated to a new node, there's no guarantee
                              that that new node has identical ulimits configured. In
                              such a scenario the pod would fail to start. If you have
                              nodes with different ulimits configured (e.g., different
                              tuned profiles) and you choose a discrete value then the
                              guidance is to use -1 and let the value be computed
                              dynamically at runtime.

                              You can monitor memory usage for router containers with the
                              following metric:
                              'container_memory_working_set_bytes{container="router",namespace="openshift-ingress"}'.

                              You can monitor memory usage of individual HAProxy
                              processes in router containers with the following metric:

                          reloadInterval:
                            description: |-
                              reloadInterval defines the minimum interval at which the router is allowed to reload
                              to accept new changes. Increasing this value can prevent the accumulation of
                              HAProxy processes, depending on the scenario. Increasing this interval can
                              also lessen load imbalance on a backend's servers when using the roundrobin
                              balancing algorithm. Alternatively, decreasing this value may decrease latency
                              since updates to HAProxy's configuration can take effect more quickly.

                              The value must be a time duration value; see <https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration>.
                              Currently, the minimum value allowed is 1s, and the maximum allowed value is
                              120s. Minimum and maximum allowed values may change in future versions of OpenShift.
                              Note that if a duration outside of these bounds is provided, the value of reloadInterval
                              will be capped/floored and not rejected (e.g. a duration of over 120s will be capped to
                              120s; the IngressController will not reject and replace this disallowed value with
                              the default).

                              A zero value for reloadInterval tells the IngressController to choose the default,
                              which is currently 5s and subject to change without notice.

                              This field expects an unsigned duration string of decimal numbers, each with optional
                              fraction and a unit suffix, e.g. "300ms", "1.5h" or "2h45m".
                              Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs" U+00B5 or "μs" U+03BC), "ms", "s", "m", "h".

                              Note: Setting a value significantly larger than the default of 5s can cause latency
                              in observing updates to routes and their endpoints. HAProxy's configuration will
                              be reloaded less frequently, and newly created routes will not be served until the
                              subsequent reload.

                              Creating more threads allows each ingress controller pod to handle more
                              connections, at the cost of more system resources being used. HAProxy
                              currently supports up to 64 threads. If this field is empty, the
                              IngressController will use the default value.  The current default is 4
                              threads, but this may change in future releases.

                              Setting this field is generally not recommended. Increasing the number
                              of HAProxy threads allows ingress controller pods to utilize more CPU
                              time under load, potentially starving other pods if set too high.
                              Reducing the number of threads may cause the ingress controller to
                              perform poorly.

                              Setting this too short can cause the router to fall back to the default

                                    for the Private Link cluster's VPC Endpoint Service. This list in Status is used to determine if a sync
                                    of Allowed Principals is needed outside of the regular reconcile period of 2hrs.

                        almost certainly wrong.
