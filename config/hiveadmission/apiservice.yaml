# register as aggregated apiserver; this has a number of benefits:
#
# - allows other kubernetes components to talk to the the admission webhook using the `kubernetes.default.svc` service
# - allows other kubernetes components to use their in-cluster credentials to communicate with the webhook
# - allows you to test the webhook using kubectl
# - allows you to govern access to the webhook using RBAC
# - prevents other extension API servers from leaking their service account tokens to the webhook
#
