## Overview

`SyncSet` and `SelectorSyncSet` objects facilitate resource management (create, update, delete, patch) in hive-managed clusters.

To use `SyncSet` objects to manage resources, you must create them in the same namespace as the `ClusterDeployment` resource that they manage. If you want to manage resources in clusters that match a specific label use `SelectorSyncSet` instead. These objects apply changes to clusters in any namespace that match the `clusterDeploymentSelector` that you set.

With both `SyncSets` and `SelectorSyncSets`, the individual resources and patches are reapplied when 2 hours have passed since their last reconciliation (by default) or if their contents are updated in the `SyncSet` or `SelectorSyncSets`.

The default `syncSetReapplyInterval` can be overridden by specifying a string duration within the `hiveconfig` such as `syncSetReapplyInterval: "1h"` for a one hour reapply interval.

## SyncSet Object Definition

`SyncSets` may contain a list of resource object definitions to create and a list of patches to be applied to existing objects.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: hive.openshift.io/v1
kind: SyncSet
metadata:
  name: mygroup
spec:
  clusterDeploymentRefs:
  - name: ClusterName

  resourceApplyMode: Upsert

  resources:
  - apiVersion: user.openshift.io/v1
    kind: Group
    metadata:
      name: mygroup
    users:
    - myuser

  patches:
  - kind: ConfigMap
    apiVersion: v1
    name: foo
    namespace: default
    patch: |-
      { "data": { "foo": "new-bar" } }
    patchType: merge
    
  secretMappings:
  - sourceRef:
      name: ad-bind-password
      namespace: default
    targetRef:
      name: ad-bind-password
      namespace: openshift-config
```

| Field | Usage |
|-------|-------|
| `clusterDeploymentRefs` | List of `ClusterDeployment` names in the current namespace which the `SyncSet` will apply to. |
| `resourceApplyMode` | Defaults to `"Upsert"`, which indicates that objects will be created and updated to match the `SyncSet`. Existing `SyncSet` resources that are not listed in the `SyncSet` are not deleted. Specify `"Sync"` to allow deleting existing objects that were previously in the resources list. This includes deleting _all_ resources when the entire SyncSet is deleted. |
| `resources` | A list of resource object definitions. Resources will be created in the referenced clusters. |
| `patches` | A list of patches to apply to existing resources in the referenced clusters. You can include any valid cluster object type in the list. By default, the `patch` `applyMode` value is `"AlwaysApply"`, which applies the patch every 2 hours. |
| `secretMappings` | A list of secret mappings. The secrets will be copied from the existing sources to the target resources in the referenced clusters |

### Example of SyncSet use

In this example you can change the replicaset of a deployment running on top of a Hive managed OpenShift cluster.

* Get the required information of the deployment

```console
$ oc get deployment <deployment name> -o yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    app: sise
  name: sise-deploy
  namespace: default
spec:
  replicas: 2
  xxxxxxx
```

* Create the `SyncSet` object in the cluster deployment namespace in Hive managed cluster as mentioned below.

```sh
oc create -f <syncset_file.yaml> -n <namespace>
```

SyncSet File:

```yaml
apiVersion: hive.openshift.io/v1
kind: SyncSet
metadata:
  name: sise-deploy-syncset
spec:
  clusterDeploymentRefs:
  - name: <cluster name>

  patches:
  - kind: Deployment
    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    name: sise-deploy
    namespace: default
    patch: |-
      { "spec": { "replicas": 3 } }
    patchType: strategic
```

* To see the syncset status, run as below.

```sh
oc get clustersync <clusterdeployment name> -o yaml
```

## SelectorSyncSet Object Definition

`SelectorSyncSet` functions identically to `SyncSet` but is applied to clusters matching `clusterDeploymentSelector` in any namespace.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: hive.openshift.io/v1
kind: SelectorSyncSet
metadata:
  name: mygroup
spec:
  resources:
  - apiVersion: user.openshift.io/v1
    kind: Group
    metadata:
      name: mygroup
    users:
    - abutcher
  clusterDeploymentSelector:
    matchLabels:
      cluster-group: abutcher
```

| Field | Usage |
|-------|-------|
| `clusterDeploymentSelector` | A key/value label pair which selects matching `ClusterDeployments` in any namespace. |

## Ordering
Hive will process [Selector]SyncSets and their resources in the following order:
1. SyncSets are processed first.
   1. Any necessary deletions are processed first.
      The order in which deletions are processed is not guaranteed.
   1. SyncSets are processed in alpha order by SyncSet name.
      Resources within a SyncSet are processed in the order in which they are supplied in the SyncSet.
1. SelectorSyncSets are processed next.
   1. Any necessary deletions are processed first.
      The order in which deletions are processed is not guaranteed.
   1. SelectorSyncSets are processed in alpha order by SelectorSyncSet name.
      Resources within a SelectorSyncSet are processed in the order in which they are supplied in the SelectorSyncSet.

## Diagnosing SyncSet Failures

To find the status of the syncset, check the cluster deployment's `ClusterSync` object in the cluster deployment namespace. Every cluster deployment has an associated `ClusterSync` object that records status within `ClusterSync.Status.SyncSets`.

```sh
oc get clustersync -n <namespace>
```

To see details, run as below.

```sh
oc get clustersync <clusterdeployment name> -o yaml
```

All (Selector)SyncSets for a given ClusterDeployment are handled by a single replica of the hive-clustersync StatefulSet.
The replica pods are named `hive-clustersync-N` where `N` is an integer such that `0 <= N < #replicas`.
`ClusterSync.Status.ControlledByReplica` indicates which replica is responsible for (the CD associated with) the ClusterSync.
Use this to determine which replica's pod logs to examine when debugging syncset operations.
For example:

```sh
$ REPLICA=`oc get clustersync -n <namespace> <clusterdeployment name> -o json | jq -r .status.controlledByReplica`
$ oc logs -n hive hive-clustersync-$REPLICA | grep <clusterdeployment name>
```

**Note:** This value is only set/updated when the cluster is installed, reachable, and not deleted.

**Note:** This value indicates the replica that *most recently* handled the ClusterSync.
If the hive-clustersync statefulset is scaled up or down, the controlling replica can change,
potentially causing logs to be spread across multiple pods.

## Changing ResourceApplyMode

Changing the `resourceApplyMode` from `"Sync"` to `"Upsert"` will remove `SyncSet` resources tracked for deletion within the corresponding `ClusterSync` object. It is possible that the `ClusterSync` controller could process a resource removal and a `resourceApplyMode` change simultaneously and when this occurs resources no longer tracked in the `SyncSet` will be orphaned rather than deleted.

Likewise, changing the `resourceApplyMode` from `"Upsert"` to `"Sync"` will add `SyncSet` resources to resources tracked for deletion within the corresponding `ClusterSync` object. When the `ClusterSync` controller processes a resource removal and a `resourceApplyMode` change simultaneously, resources removed will be orphaned rather than deleted.
